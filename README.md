*Speaker*:-Prof. Harpreet Kaur (HOD, Applied Science)
- Topic: Independent Thought, Self-Importance & Growing 'P' Vertically
- Message:-Dr. Harpreet Kaur ma'am delivered an inspiring lecture at our induction program. She told us how crucial it is for us students to have independent thinking — we should be able   to think for ourselves and not blindly do what other people tell us to do. She also emphasized the concept of self-worth, telling us never to undervalue ourselves.
- One of the most important things she brought out in her session was the concept of "Growing P along the vertical". She clarified that true growth is achieved by building ourselves step    by step on some fundamentals. These were the 6 Ps:

- *Passion*:– the push factor
- *Patience*:– things are not instant, nothing happens overnight
- *Persistence*:– trying and trying again, irrespective of what
- *Perseverance*:– remaining committed even when things become difficult
- *Prayer*:- remaining in touch with yourself or a higher power for peace and courage
- *Placement*:– the ultimate goal when all else above is secured

- Her message was concise yet strong: when we prioritize these values, not only will we find placement, but we'll become confident, capable individuals.
