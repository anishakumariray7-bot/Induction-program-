She also emphasized the concept of self-worth, telling us never to undervalue ourselves.
- One of the most important things she brought out in her session was the concept of "Growing P along the vertical". She clarified that true growth is achieved by building ourselves step    by step on some fundamentals. These were the 6 Ps:

- *Prayer*:- remaining in touch with yourself or a higher power for peace and courage
